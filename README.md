# Canonical_Labeling_ESU
Algorithms that finds subgraphs of a size k, make the canonical labeling and returns only the graphs not repeated.

## ESU algorithm
The ESU is a algorithm used for find all the subgraphs of a size k, and returns to the user. 
Is an algorithm with the complexity exponential of the number of nodes of a graph.
Some analises were made, like time, memory and number of subgraph finded in a execution.

## Nauty and Traces
The Nauty and Traces is a tool made for compare graphs, checking if some graphs are isomorphics.
In this work, this tool is used for generate a canonical labeling of the subgraphs finded, in addition to returns only the first ocurrence of a graph canonized.
